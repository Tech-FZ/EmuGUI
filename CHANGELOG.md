- The Windows binaries will be made with Python 3.10.8 instead of 3.10.7.
- You can now create custom *.qss stylesheets. Just don't call it Windows, windowsvista, Fusion, Breeze or something else that one or another system might reserve for itself.

## Changes compared to v0.7.5.5111

- Support for the MIPS and MIPS64 big-endian architectures has been added.
- We began to work on a better dialog for editing existing virtual machines.
- The .gitignore file also experienced a change: The ./ suffix is no longer present - that's how the file works.
- The Icelake-Client x86/x64 CPU, which has been removed from QEMU 7.1, is depreciated on EmuGUI now. Please change the CPU on affected VMs as soon as possible. This measure is already present in 0.7.6.5112, but it had to be written into this version as well.
- The old editing VM dialog might have crashed if your installation didn't contain the EmuGUI.png icon. That is now fixed in both 0.7 and 0.8.

## Changes compared to 0.7.3.5109

- On some Linux configurations, the main branch was prone to crash. While the fix was exclusive to the Linux binaries in the previous two updates, the main code should also be fixed now.
- Also, some more phrases and words have been (partially) translated into Ukrainian.
- Obsolete code which is no longer in use within EmuGUI has been either commented out or removed as a whole.
- To make translating EmuGUI easier in the future, comments with the English translation have been added to all currently available ones.
- Also, something inside the German translation had to be corrected.

- At least you can use EmuGUI normally now, except you can't change the language too often in a single session.

# EmuGUI v0.6.1

- A spacing mistake has been fixed.
- The editing VM dialog had a bug which sometimes didn't apply the actual architecture of the VM.
