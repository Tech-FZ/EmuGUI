# EmuGUI v0.6.1

- A spacing mistake has been fixed.
- The editing VM dialog had a bug which sometimes didn't apply the actual architecture of the VM.

- PowerPC 64-bit and MIPSel 32-bit architectures have been added.
- Thanks to BasDeGamer for fixing the spelling mistake on README.md. Credits to him or her go to CONTRIBUTORS.md.
- Also, I fear that I violated an Ukrainian grammar rule in the main menu tab (hopefully fixed).

- Resolved an issue which caused some virtual machines to be impossible to create

# EmuGUI v0.4.1

- Fixed an issue which caused USB input devices on ARM machines not to be accepted because USB support was being initialized too late.
- To do that, I had to specify an USB 1.1 controller in the VM bootcode.
- Also, to make it easier, USB support is enabled automatically if you decide to use an USB device.
- With that, a network issue has been caused on ARM emulator instances. That has been fixed by adding the virtio-net-device.
